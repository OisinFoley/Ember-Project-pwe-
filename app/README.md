# This is Erik's video: "Ember Closure Actions and Ember Advanced Components Tutorial" and features some of his other videos.
## Main point to note is that the closure action is that 'this.attrs.pressed' in the stapler source file refers to the LHS of the equals when implementing the office-staplers component inside of his application.hbs.
## The 'pressed' action enclosed in brackets in the component implementation is associated with the (deprecated) controller he has used.
